                        <p>Gazprom, a stalwart in Russia's energy sector, commands a pivotal role as a state-owned entity since its establishment in 1989. Focused on the exploration, production, transportation, and sale of natural gas, Gazprom stands as a global leader with colossal reserves and formidable operational capabilities. Its influence spans both domestic and international spheres, shaping energy markets and geopolitical dynamics.</p>

                    <h3>Environmental Impact:</h3>
                        <p>The expansive operations of Gazprom in the oil and gas industry wield considerable environmental consequences, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and the exacerbation of climate change. The extraction, refining, and utilization of fossil fuels constitute significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and other pollutants, exacerbating global warming and environmental degradation. In 2020, Gazprom's estimated CO2 emissions stood at approximately 210.32 million metric tons, underlining the magnitude of its environmental impact and the imperative to mitigate its contribution to climate change.</p>
